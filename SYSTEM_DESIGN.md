# Weather Forecast Web Application System Design

## Overview

The Weather Forecast Web Application is designed to provide users with weather forecasts for specific locations. The application is built using Python, Streamlit, and external APIs to deliver a user-friendly interface for accessing temperature and sky condition data for upcoming days.

## Architecture

The system architecture consists of three main components:

1. **User Interface (Streamlit):**
   - The front-end of the application is developed using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications.
   - Users interact with the interface to input their desired location, select forecast days, and choose between temperature and sky conditions.

2. **Backend Logic (backend.py):**
   - The backend logic interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on user inputs.
   - The API key is securely stored and used to authenticate requests to the external API.
   - The `get_data` function fetches relevant weather data and filters it to match user requirements.

3. **Data Visualization (main.py):**
   - The main application file integrates user input, backend data fetching, and data visualization components.
   - Users' inputs are used to customize the visualization type (temperature or sky conditions) and the location.
   - Plotly Express is used to create interactive graphs and images that display the weather forecast data.

## Data Flow

1. The user accesses the Streamlit application through their web browser.
2. The user provides input for the desired location, forecast days, and data type (temperature or sky conditions).
3. Streamlit handles the user input and communicates with the backend logic (`backend.py`).
4. The backend logic sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for the specified location.
5. The API responds with the requested weather data, including temperature and sky conditions.
6. The backend filters the data based on the user's forecast day selection and prepares it for visualization.
7. The filtered data is passed back to the Streamlit application.
8. Streamlit uses Plotly Express to create interactive visualizations based on the selected data type.
9. The visualizations are displayed on the Streamlit interface, providing the user with weather insights.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Plotly Express
- Requests
- OpenWeatherMap API

## Conclusion

The Weather Forecast Web Application demonstrates how the synergy of Python programming, interactive web frameworks, and external APIs can result in a powerful and user-centric application. This system design ensures efficient data flow, secure API key usage, and an engaging user experience, making weather forecasts accessible and insightful.
